TracingPyper is a Python application designed for edge detection and tracing of microscopy images. The app allows users to manipulate edge detection sensitivity, overlay and edit generated traces, and save images with transparent backgrounds. Additionally, users can open these images in paint or other drawing tools for further customization and coloring.

#Features
1. Edge Detection: Apply edge detection algorithms to trace microscopy images.
2. Sensitivity Adjustment: Manipulate the sensitivity of the edge detection to capture desired details.
3. Overlay and Edit: Draw and erase on the generated overlay as a canvas.
4. Save with Transparency: Save the edited image with a transparent background.
5. External Editing: Open the saved image in paint or other drawing tools for further customization.
